# NASA Voyager 1

1977-present
No spacecraft has gone farther than NASA's Voyager 1. Launched in 1977 to fly by Jupiter and Saturn, 
Voyager 1 crossed into interstellar space in August 2012 and continues to collect data.

Its currently at 15 Billion miles away.

These numbers initially seem to make no sense but we can transform them into something understandable. The key is this symbol.
The hydrogen atom.
Notice the electrons on the atoms. They are not the same

## Hyperfine transition
Electron in the hydrogen atom changes direction spontaneously in about 10 million years. When this happens, the Hydrogen atom emits an electromagnetic wave with a wavelength of 21 cm and a frequency of 1420.406 MHz

3.6 seconds is a single record spin time and 3229 seconds is the total run time of the record.

When they run the record, they will hear welcome messages spoken in different languages and also some weird sounds. That's the data for the images.

The next symbols are for the audio waves and the binary numbers

If they can decode these waves and turn them back into the images. They will see different images like below.
