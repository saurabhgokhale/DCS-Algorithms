ChatGPT transformer is designed to accept a piece of text and maybe some images or audio accompanying it and produce a prediction of what comes next in the passage.

Now, it does not feel like the chatGPT that you may have seen.

However, once you have a prediction modal like this, we can feed the same prediction data back to the model to generate the next text.
